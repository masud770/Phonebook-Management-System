### 📘 Project Description: Phonebook Management System in C

This project is an **academic team project** developed as part of our coursework in C programming at **Daffodil International University**.  
The **Phonebook Management System** is a **console-based application** built using the **C language**, designed to efficiently manage personal contact information.  
It allows users to **add, view, search, edit, and delete** contacts while ensuring **data validation** and **persistent storage** using a binary file system (`phonebook.dat`).

The program demonstrates the use of **structures**, **file handling**, **input validation**, and **modular programming** in C.  
A dedicated function `isValidEmail()` ensures that only properly formatted emails are stored, maintaining data integrity.  
The system features a **menu-driven interface** that provides a user-friendly experience for smooth navigation through different operations.

This project helped us gain hands-on experience in **C programming**, **structured data management**, and **team-based software development**.  
It reflects our understanding of **core programming concepts**, including **data structures, modular code design, and file I/O operations**.
